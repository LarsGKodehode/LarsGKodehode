Hi im @LarsGKodehode

This is my starting reposotory while participating in a HTML, CSS and JavaScript course.

It will contain projects to show what part of the course I've been though.

<!---
LarsGKodehode/LarsGKodehode is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
